            The telltale signs that your air ducts need to be cleaned.

              <p>
                If you’ve smoked in your home, even for a short time, your air
                ducts probably need to be cleaned. This is because smoke
                contains toxins that can cling to the air ducts and lessen their
                performance. Cigarette smoke isn’t the only type of pollution
                that your air ducts might have to deal with. In fact, other
                contaminants like mold, mildew and dust mites can be even more
                harmful to your home’s air quality.
              </p>
              <p>
                Dirty air ducts can affect the performance of your heating and
                cooling system. For example, they might make it harder for your
                heater or AC filters to do their job because they restrict
                airflow. Over time, dirty air ducts can lead to higher energy
                bills and more frequent maintenance costs. If you’re worried
                that your air ducts are dirty, it’s a good idea to have them
                cleaned right away. Doing so can help improve the performance of
                your heating and cooling system which means lower energy bills
                and less stress on your HVAC unit.

          <h2>How often should your air ducts be cleaned, on average?</h2>
          <p>
            As a general rule of thumb, it’s best to have your air ducts cleaned
            every two years. This is important because you spend about 90% of
            your time indoors so the quality of the air in your home really
            matters. If you have allergies or other respiratory conditions,
            however, perhaps consider having them cleaned more often. This is
            especially true if your symptoms tend to get worse when the seasons
            change. If you have several people living in your home, consider
            having them cleaned every year. This is because there will be more
            contaminants floating through the air which means a greater risk of
            exposure to allergens and other pollutants.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you’re not sure how often your air ducts need to be cleaned, it’s
            advisable to get them inspected and professionally cleaned at least
            once every two years.

          <h2>What are the benefits of having clean Air Ducts?</h2>
          <p>
            The benefits of having your air ducts cleaned are numerous. First,
            it’s an effective way to boost the quality of the air in your home.
            Since pollutants can cause respiratory problems and other health
            concerns, this is definitely something you want to avoid! This is
            particularly true if you have anyone in your home who might be more
            susceptible to allergies or respiratory conditions, including young
            children.
          </p>
          <p>
            Having your air ducts professionally cleaned can also help improve
            the performance of your heating and cooling system. This means lower
            energy bills and less stress on your HVAC unit, which is definitely
            something to keep in mind. Finally, it’s always nice to be able to
            breathe clean air so if you suffer from allergies or other
            respiratory problems, you might consider having your air ducts
            cleaned by a professional.

                What are some things to keep in mind when choosing a company to
                clean your air ducts?
              </h2>
              <p>
                It’s generally a good idea to hire a company that is certified
                by NADCA or the EPA. This certification will ensure that your
                air ducts are cleaned in an effective and professional way. Ask
                for referrals from friends, family members, co-workers or
                neighbors who have recently had their air ducts professionally
                cleaned. They should be able to provide you with the name of a
                company that did an excellent job for them.
              </p>
            </div>
          </div>
          <p>
            When you’re looking into companies to clean your air ducts, inquire
            about their prices and whether or not they provide discounts.
            Experience is another thing to keep in mind because it’s important
            to hire someone who has cleaned air ducts before and knows how to
            get the job done. It’s also a wise idea to find out what sort of
            equipment they’ll be using and whether or not they’re going to need
            to move any of your furniture.
          </p>
          <p>
            Before you hire a company to clean your air ducts, make sure that it
            is insured in case damage occurs. If necessary, hire a team who will
            provide you with a written estimate that details the cost of
            cleaning your air ducts.
